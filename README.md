# cartpole_lqr_control
The repository is created to control a cart-pole system using LQR Control. In the following system, 
* pole mass m = 1 kg
* cart mass M = 10 kg
* link length L =  1 m
* time step dt = 0.1 s
* time range trange = 5 s
* gravitational acceleration g = 9.81 m/s^2

The resulting responses are the same as the following:
